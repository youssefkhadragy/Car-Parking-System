# Car-Parking-System
**The file carpark.vhd is the VHDL code of the car parking system synthesized in Intel Quartus Prime. This code was then used to program the Altera FPGA board.**\
**<ins>Description:</ins>** This car parking system is used to detect empty spots in a car park by the use of proximity sensors for each parking slot. If the parking slot is empty, a green LED turns on to indicate the spot is empty. Otherwise, the a red LED turns on and the green LED turns off to indicate the parking slot is taken.\
**<ins>Description:</ins>** This system was developed to facilitate the process of finding a parking slot in closed or underground parkings by allowing drivers to quickly identify the availabilty of a parking slot from a distance where the parking slot itself is not necessary visible.
